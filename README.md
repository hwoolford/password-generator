# Password-Generator

## Description

This project involves modifying JavaScript starter code to bring functionality to the Password Generator website. The HTML, CSS, and partial Javascript was provided for the challenge.

Users click the "Generate Password" button to receive prompts for their password criteria. Users set password length and character types to include in the password. Once all options are selected, the password appears on the page.

### Visuals

The first gif shows the functionality of the generator.

The second gif shows the alerts users receive when they either do not enter a password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters, or when they do not include at least one character type in the password.
